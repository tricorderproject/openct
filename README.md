# Introduction

The Open Source Computed Tomography (CT) Scanner project aims to move towards creating an inexpensive and open desktop computed tomography scanner for academic and educational purposes.  The most common form of computed tomography is radiographic using x-rays or gamma rays, although it is my hope that this project can serve as a general platform for other kinds of tomographic research with other, safer wavelengths. 

This project is intended for use with radioisotope "check" sources that are many orders of magnitude less intense than sources in a commercial or medical radiographic setups.  This means that even very low resolution images will take hours of measurement and integration time to assemble, and the resolution and signal to noise ratio of a scan are largely a function of time (and patience).  Much of the spirit of this project is to move towards creating better scans through the use of clever signal processing techniques or wavelengths that can be more efficiently detected, rather than increasing source intensity. 

# Open Source

This project is open hardware and is released under various open licenses.  Please see LICENSES.TXT for details.

For potential contributors, a list of suggested contributions and next steps can be found in TODO.TXT .

# Warning

This project has a variety of dangers associated with it, including (without limitation) its assembly and use.  This generally includes the typical hazards involved with assembling, testing, and using electronics projects, CNC projects, as well as using hand tools, power tools, and CNC manufacturing tools such as laser cutters or CNC routers.  This is not a first project in any of these areas, and one should be well experienced and comfortable in all aspects of this project's design, assembly, and use. 

In addition, for radiography this project makes use of a low intensity sealed radioactive radioisotope source.  You should be experienced and extremely comfortable with handling and using radioactive sources, understanding the potential dangers (and how to minimize them), as well as any local laws or regulations regarding such material.  Having advanced training in medical imaging, radiography, and/or radiation biophysics is highly recommended.  

In no case should any living thing be placed inside of or be scanned by the device.
